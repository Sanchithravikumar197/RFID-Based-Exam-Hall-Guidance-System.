The project on an RFID-Based Exam Hall Guidance System. This system is designed to streamline the process of student entry during examinations by displaying the allocated exam hall number when a student scans their RFID card. By using RFID technology, the system ensures quick identification and efficient guidance without the need for manual checking or confusion. It simplifies the process for both students and exam coordinators, helping maintain order and saving time during exam sessions. Through this project, I gained practical experience in working with RFID modules, microcontroller programming, and real-time display systems, further enhancing my skills in embedded systems and automation.
