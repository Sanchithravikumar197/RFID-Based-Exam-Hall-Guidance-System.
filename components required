HARDWARE  COMPONENTS
RFID Tags: Passive tags embedded in student ID cards (13.56 MHz).
•	RFID Reader: Short-range reader (RC522 or similar), reads card when tapped.
•	Microcontroller: Arduino Uno  for processing.
•	LCD/LED Display: 16x2 LCD  screen to show seat details.
•	Power Supply: 9V regulated source depending on components.

 
SOFTWARE COMPONENTS
•	Arduino IDE: Used for writing and uploading microcontroller code.
•	RFID Library: For interfacing with the RC522 module.
•	Preloaded Database: Student ID and seat number mapping (stored in code or external memory like EEPROM/SD card).
•	Display Control Logic: To format and display output.
